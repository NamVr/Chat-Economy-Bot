# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We have discontinued the initial version 1.0.0! We no longer support it, either the Discord API or Discord.js. <br>
Upcoming versions from v2 + will be supported till the time the Discord ditches the API version (Discord.js v13). <br>

| Version | Supported          |

| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report any vulnerability on github**!

Please let me know immediately via emails or discord dm! <br>
**Discord**: `allroundernaman#3915` <br>
**Email**: `info@namanvrati.cf` <br>

Whenever I receive a vulnerability report, I'll cross-examine the report and act on it. <br>
I'll also follow you up by the same means of communication to let you know whether it was accepted or declined. <br>
Of course, suitable actions will be taken as fast as possible! <br>
