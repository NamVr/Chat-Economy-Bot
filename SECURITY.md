## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report vulnerabilities on GitHub**!

Please let me know immediately via email or Discord DM (Direct Message)! <br>
**Discord**: `namanvrati` <br>
**Email**: `info@namanvrati.me` <br>

Whenever I receive a vulnerability report, I will cross-examine the report and act on it appropriately. <br>
I will also follow up via the same means of communication to let you know whether it was accepted or declined. <br>
Suitable action will be taken as fast as possible. <br>
